# exceptions

This repo contains the code from the merge and Exception handling practice assignment.

Every contributure has added a custom exception class, added a catch block to the try-catch in main, and pushed their code DIRECTLY INTO MAIN branch without overwriting anyone else's code. (Normally, push into your branch and make a pull request).
